This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# First commit for Sprint Advanced React

# I can't find the Answers.md file to add the question answers, so adding them here

1. We would use class components over functional components (assuming hooks removed) primarily because class components can hold state (or data), whereas functional components would be for presentational, such as: displaying data, holding and/or displaying other components, or passing props to other components. Class components also hold numerous life cycle methods that help with additional functionality.

2. Class components serve a purpose during the birth/mounting stage where methods and events occur, growth where state is set, and when components die and are removed from the DOM/screen. Three lifecycle methods are:
- componentDidMount: loading data from internal or external 3rd party api.
- componentDidUpdate: add event listeners if you need them
- componentWillUnmount: remove event listeners or other clean up.

3. The purpose of a custom hook is to build custom functions/hooks that help reduce code and share functionality across other functions. 

4. It is import to test our app for the following reasons: reduce technical debt, reduce bugs during the development stage, trust the code, and make sure your app does what the users expect it.
